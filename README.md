# Incorrect Null Handling in JavaScript Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript function parameter handling. The `foo` function incorrectly returns `null` when null values are passed as parameters.  The solution illustrates how to improve the function by explicitly throwing an error in such cases, which leads to better error handling and maintainability. This promotes better code quality by handling exceptional cases effectively and informing users of potential problems. 

## Bug
The original `foo` function returns `null` when either `a` or `b` is `null`. This might lead to unexpected behavior in applications because null is often confused with zero or an empty string. A better approach is to handle null parameters explicitly, raising an error that alerts the caller of incorrect usage, thus improving code robustness and predictability. 

## Solution
The solution demonstrates how to throw a TypeError when null values are provided. This approach is preferred as it clearly indicates an invalid input and allows for better error handling in the calling code. This helps in improving debugging and maintenance, making it easier to identify the root cause of errors related to incorrect function inputs.
